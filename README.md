# Model Documentation
Hi guys! Welcome to our first GIT. From now on, well, to the end of the competition, we will share our code and models here. Although our ranking is not that good and our models are naive, we still keep trying and are finding out better-performed models. No more to say, come guys! To get our Metal.

Our code is based on the [YouTube-8M Tensorflow Starter](https://github.com/google/youtube-8m) Code.
